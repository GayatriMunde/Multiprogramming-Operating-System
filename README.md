# 🖥️ Multiprogramming Operating System
Welcome to the Multiprogramming Operating System project! 🚀 This project simulates the basic principles of a multiprogramming OS, focusing on efficient CPU utilization, process scheduling, and memory management.

### 📚 About
This repository demonstrates how an operating system manages multiple programs or processes simultaneously. The main aim is to simulate concepts like CPU scheduling, process management, and resource allocation in a multiprogramming environment.

### ✨ Features
- Process Scheduling: Simulates process scheduling algorithms like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and others.
- CPU Utilization: Demonstrates efficient CPU resource management.
- Process Management: Manages processes in a system, including starting, stopping, and switching processes.
- Memory Management: Simulates memory allocation for processes.

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/GayatriMunde/Multiprogramming-Operating-System.git```
2. Compile the code: ```g++ main.cpp -o multiprogramming_os```
3. Run the program: ```./multiprogramming_os```

### 🖥️ Project Structure
- main.cpp – Contains the core logic for process scheduling and management.
- processes.txt – Sample input for process scheduling.
- README.md – Documentation for the project.

### 📝 Usage
After running the program, you can interact with the system to simulate and test different scheduling algorithms and memory management techniques.

### 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork this repo, submit issues, or contribute to improve the code! 🌱
